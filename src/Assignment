Introduction to OOP with Java Webshop
Exercise 1: First Class
Create a simple product class
Task:----
Create a Product class with name, price and stock quantity
Add a constructor that sets the values
Create a method that prints product information
Test by creating some products in the main method
Reflect on:--
Try:
What is the difference from just using variables?
Why is it good to collect related data in a class?
1. First with all variables public
2. Then with private variables and get methods
Exercise 2: Encapsulation
Protect data and add validation
Task:----
Make all variables private
Create get/set methods
Add simple validation (price > 0, stock quantity >= 0)
Add a method to reduce stock balance
Reflect on:--
Why do we want to protect our variables?
What happens if we don't validate the data?
Exercise 3: Multiple Classes
Introduce collaboration between classes
Task:
--
Create a ShoppingCart class that can contain products
Add methods to:
● Add products
● Calculate total price
● View shopping cart contents
Reflect on:--
How can classes collaborate?
Which class should be responsible for what?
Exercise 4: Inheritance
Introduce different types of products
Task:--
Create a DigitalProduct that inherits from Product
Create a PhysicalProduct that inherits from Product
Add specific properties for each type
● Digital: download link
● Physical: weight
Reflect on:--
What functionality can be reused?
What needs to be different for different product types?
Tips for all exercises----
Start simple, add more gradually
Test the code often with different values
Focus on understanding one concept at a time
Think about real-world examples of the concepts
Good questions to ask yourself--
What am I trying to protect with encapsulation?
When is it appropriate to inherit vs. create a new class?
How can I make the code easier to understand?
